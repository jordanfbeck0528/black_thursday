1. __What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?__

  * Learn how to manipulate large sets of data.  Incorporating new gems and tools ie specharness, SimpleCov, Hound CI.
Get better at github collaboration and merging of code base.  Enrichment learning and getting as far as we can.  Everyone
understands all of the concepts and the code base.

__What is your/our collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?__

Due to the size of our group we will NEED to utilize both styles. 

__How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?__

Jacob - needs a minute to gather his thoughts before articulating.
Jake - please tell me early and often when I have a problem in my logic/code.  I very much like being told when I'm wrong.
Jeremiah - prefers direct communication, eager to fix things ASAP.
Genevieve - I appreciate constructive criticism and likes to be shown (constructively) how to improve.
Jordan - Communicate early and often issues to help grow and learn.  Wants feedback and some form of validation to make sure
both people are on the same page before moving on.

__How would you describe your work style?__

Refactor what you can when writing the first time (identation, spacing etc).  After functionality is at a sufficeint point THEN
go back and refactor for better enumerables, using helper methods more effectively, etc.

__What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?__

Jacob - can listen and thoughtful when given large concepts
Jeremiah - more analytical, pretty good with communication
Jake - analytical minded and good with communication
Genevieve - good at breaking down things into smaller parts/segmentation
Jordan - fantastic with large strings of logic and good at whiteboarding/planning

__Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?__

Did the best when we have a plan (psuedo code, whiteboarding).  Things went badly when there wasn't clear and concise 
expectations.  As a group this large we need to have a defined path/plan to ensure we are working together and continually
rework that path/plan as the project progresses. 

__How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?__

Daily checkin/meeting of at least 20 minutes.

__How will we overcome obstacles?__

Take a step back and understand the issue and where we want to get to.  Communication.  Ask each other for help, don't be shy
about specifically including other group members.

__What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?__

Respect each other's time and effort.  Be punctual and communicate if you aren't able to finalize something you agreed to.
Again, don't be afraid to reach out if having an issue.

__What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?__

Monday-Thursday 4-5 can't work for group meetings. Tuesday 5-6 pm no group meetings.
Saturday 10-noon no good.  Try to take some time off on Sunday from the project.
Try to schedule as much as we can.

Timezones: all in Mountain Time, all other timezones are inferior.

__What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?__

Jacob - take time to make sure he is clear with his feedback, worried about coming off negatively.
Jordan - pretty direct and fast, will be quicker with his feedback and work together on the topic the feedback is centered 
around. 
Jeremiah - likes to ask questions to understand the topic at hand before dicussing so as to understand more fully.  Conversely, prefers more direct feedback on his own work.
Jake - like Jeremiah I like to have discussions before giving feedback to someone else, also prefer direct feedback back to me.
Genevieve - gives direct feedback with intent to be kind, also prefers direct feedback and don't feel like you have to walk on eggshells. 

__What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?__

Will circle back on this one after we have more of a set plan for starting the project and understanding what it entails

__What tools do you want to use to manage the project?__

Github, slack, zoom, tuple, google.

__How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?__

Communicate open and honestly when facing issues, and try and say it earlier vs struggling alone with it.  Ask for help before you hit a "deadline" so nobody is surprised.  Escalate issues "up" through the group.  We will try mitigate these issues with our daily check ins.

__How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?__

All functionality works and every group member has a working understanding of all the pieces.  All of the code base has at least been viewed/reviewed by all team members.  During daily checkins have review before we discuss moving forward, splitting time accordingly as needed.

__How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?__

As they happen. Praise should be easy to come by.  Tiny rocks, not thrown, but carefully delivered.
